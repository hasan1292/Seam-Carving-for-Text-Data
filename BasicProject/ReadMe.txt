Seam Carving Algorithm Implemented By Hasan Iqbal v1.0 Release

--------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to the Seam Carving Algorithm Implemented By Hasan Iqbal v1.0 Release! This readme includes the basic project 

requirements, JDK Requirements, How to run, output, notes and Help Required of programming project of Algorithms 
Course



1. Basic Project Requirement:

-----------------------------


i) Take input in form of .txt file. First line indicates number of rows, columns and seam lines to be done.


ii) Energy Matrix is already given in input. No need to calculate it.

iii) Rest of the lines of input file indicates elements of energy matrix.


iv) Apply the idea given by Shai Avidan 
and Ariel Shamir
 in 2007 in their paper "Seam Carving for Content-Aware Image
 
Resizing".

v) Process the input .txt file and give output in separate .txt file.



2) JDK Requirements:

--------------------
i) This project is made in JDK 1.8.0_102.


ii) No external libraries or 3rd party packages are utilised so hypothetically this software should support Java JDK 1.5
or higher.



3) How to Run:

--------------
i) Unzip the zipped file "BasicProject_2016280141" at any folder inside your pc.

ii) For Windows, Start cmd prompt in your pc. For Mac OS, Start terminal in your pc.

iii) Navigate to the folder where you have placed the zipped file using "cd _ _ _*" command.


iv) After you have successfully navigated to the folder, use this command -> cd BasicProject_2016280141

v) Then after navigating to the BasicProject_2016280141 folder, use this command -> javac BasicProject.java


vi) You will see a BasicProject.class file if command in 5th step executed successfully. All the basic inputs are already
    pasted inside the folder with names 1-in.txt, 2-in.txt, 3-in.txt and 4.in-txt. You can paste more input if you want inside
    this folder.


vii) After making class file, use this command if you want to run program -> java BasicProject filename.


viii) For example, if you want to give input 1-in.txt, use this command -> java BasicProject 1-in.txt

ix) If program terminates successfully, that is you see a message on command prompt that Seam Carving Done!, a corresponding 

    output file for each input file will be created in the same folder.

x) For example for 1-in.txt input, 1-out.txt output file will be generated. For 2-in.txt , 2-out.txt will be generated and so
   on.



4) Output:
----------


i) Output of the program will be generated and stored in .txt file with the respective name of input .txt file and it will be
   generated 
inside the same folder where input file is placed.


ii) Output will also be an energy matrix with same number of rows but reduced number of columns.


iii) For example the input matrix had 1000 rows and 1000 columns and 100 lines for seams then the output matrix will contain
 
     1000 rows and 900 columns.

iv) On command Prompt or Terminal you can also see the total time spent by algorithm for generating output.



5) Notes:
---------
i) This Project was created by using eclipse IDE.


ii) For pseudocode and detailed implementation of algorithm, see project report in the same zipped file where BasicProject.java
 
    is placed.

iii) This project is designed only for .txt files input and their first line should indicate the number of rows, columns and
     seams required.

iv) This project completes all the basic requirements given by Teaching Assistant Martin Cao.



6) Help Required:
